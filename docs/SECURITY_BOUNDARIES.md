# Security Boundaries

Outbox payloads are schema-versioned, bounded, canonical, and reject
credential-like keys. Raw claim tokens are never stored—only hashes. Events,
attempts, metrics, audit summaries, and dead-letter views omit raw provider
payloads, credentials, and command output.

Credentials are injected only at adapter invocation and are excluded from
checkpoints, events, task payloads, command logs, and exception messages.
Executables, environment keys, repository URLs, paths, branches, output size,
and timeouts are allow-listed or bounded.

External providers and generated patches are untrusted. Human review is
required before approval; protected branches deny writes by default. Operators
must restrict workspace roots, use least-privilege credentials, review audit
records, reconcile interrupted operations, and rotate any credential suspected
of exposure.

# Managed runtime configuration boundaries

Managed runtime configuration persists public environment bindings and opaque secret references,
never resolved secret values. Secret-like keys are prohibited in public bindings, and the same key
cannot appear in both public and secret sets. Repository and endpoint URLs cannot contain embedded
credentials. Configuration digests cover opaque references, not secret values, so credential rotation
does not require exposing or rewriting an accepted record.

Commands are argument arrays with preserved order. Shell interpreters, shell operators, unsafe
relative working directories, and unbounded values are rejected before persistence. Registration
enforces operator-owned repository-host, executable, origin, environment-name, and exact or
prefix-based opaque-secret-reference policies. Loopback HTTP is allowed only for an isolated local
environment; non-loopback service endpoints require HTTPS, and every readiness origin must be
explicitly allowed by the declaration.

The configuration service has no Git, subprocess, socket, HTTP, secret-manager, or browser adapter.
Day 6 and Day 7 providers must consume a verified configuration revision and remain subject to
separate authorization, workspace containment, redaction, evidence, and shutdown controls.

# Managed product environment boundaries

Day 6 is the first managed-runtime side-effect boundary. It reloads an exact persisted configuration
revision and rechecks current operator policy before resolving a secret or invoking Git. Local source
preparation disables interactive Git and ambient system/global configuration, checks out the full SHA
detached, removes every remote, rejects escaping symlinks and working directories, and uses a private
run-specific workspace.

Runtime commands are exact argument arrays with no shell. Processes receive only a minimal base
environment plus exact declared public and resolved-secret bindings. Raw output is not retained;
secret values are replaced before bounded output hashing. Readiness disables ambient proxies and
redirects and can contact only a configuration and operator-approved origin. Every started process is
stopped in reverse order after success or failure. Unproven process termination or cleanup fails
closed as `RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED` and retains the workspace for explicit operator handling.
The included local provider requires POSIX process-group control. Windows construction fails closed
until a Job Object or equivalent full-process-tree adapter is implemented.

The environment result omits raw output, secret values/references, process handles, and local paths.
Day 6 has no browser, repository-write, merge, deployment, or release API.

# Process and PostgreSQL boundaries

Serializable worker configuration accepts connection references, never raw database
URLs or provider credentials. Spawned children reconstruct live clients and
connections locally. Operational state excludes environment variables, raw provider
responses, secrets, and unbounded exception text. Connection failures are mapped to
redacted provider-neutral errors.
